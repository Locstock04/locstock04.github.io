## About
This game was made for a small project in Year 8 to demonstrate knowledge about Vikings, it was developed in my free time over around a week. The main objective of the game is to travel down to an island and trade items up until you can get a coin

Developed in Gamemaker Studio 2, all art and programming by myself
